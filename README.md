# T-Pot-Honeypot-Deployment
This project involves the deployment and management of a T-Pot Multi-Honeypot Platform hosted on Microsoft Azure.
The objective was to create a controlled environment to attract and analyze real-world cyberattacks, gathering threat intelligence on current attack vectors, common payloads, and attacker origins.

By exposing this instance to the public internet, I successfully captured and analyzed over 93,000+ attacks in a 30-day period, gaining insights into automated botnet behaviors and brute-force patterns.

**Tech Stack**:
Cloud Provider: Microsoft Azure (West US 2 Region)

OS: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS

Platform: T-Pot (Universal Multi-Honeypot Platform)

**Tools & Services**:

Docker & Docker Compose: Container orchestration for honeypot services.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Log ingestion, processing, and visualization.

Cowrie: SSH/Telnet interaction honeypot.

Elasticvue: Elasticsearch cluster monitoring.

Cisco Talos: External IP reputation verification.

**Visual Walkthrough & Analysis**
1. Infrastructure Setup (Azure Cloud)
Description: The honeypot is hosted on a Standard D4 v4 Azure Virtual Machine (4 vCPUs, 16 GiB Memory) running Ubuntu 22.04.

Significance: High availability configuration with Network Security Groups (NSGs) tuned to allow traffic on honeypot-specific ports while securing management interfaces.

2. Live Attack Feed (T-Pot Attack Map)
Description: A real-time visualization of incoming attacks. The dashboard captures source IP, country of origin, and the specific honeypot triggered (e.g., Cowrie).

Observation: Immediate high-volume traffic was observed targeting port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTTP). The log feed shows rapid-fire attempts from diverse geolocations including Vietnam, China, and the Netherlands.

3. Attack Analytics Dashboard (Kibana)
Key Metrics:

Total Attacks: 93,000+ recorded events.

__Top Honeypots__: "Cowrie" (SSH interaction) is the primary target, absorbing nearly all attempts.

Global Heatmap: Visual concentration of attacker origins, highlighting global botnet distribution.

4. Threat Intelligence & Pattern Recognition
Description: Analysis of specific attack vectors.

Username Tagcloud: Shows the most attempted usernames during brute-force attacks. root, admin, and user are the most common, indicating automated scripts using default credential lists.

Password Tagcloud: Common passwords attempted include 123456, password, and admin123.

5. Log Granularity & Filtering
Description: Deep dive into raw logs using the 'Discover' tab in Kibana.

Significance: This view allows for filtering by source_ip, timestamp, or attack_type. It is crucial for isolating specific incidents and reconstructing the timeline of an attack.

6. Cluster Health Monitoring
Description: Monitoring the backend health of the Elasticsearch cluster using Elasticvue.

__Status__: The cluster is "Green" with 1 node and 44 active shards, indicating a healthy ingestion pipeline capable of handling the high volume of write operations generated by the honeypots.

7. External Verification (OSINT)
Description: Cross-referencing attacking IPs using Cisco Talos Intelligence.

**Key Takeaways**:
Botnet Prevalence: 
1. The speed at which a new public IP is discovered and targeted by botnets is almost immediate (often within minutes of deployment).

2. Credential Stuffing: The vast majority of attacks rely on top-100 common credential lists, reinforcing the importance of strong password policies and MFA.

3. Cloud Security: Successfully managing a vulnerable machine in the cloud requires careful network segregation to prevent lateral movement to other resources.
